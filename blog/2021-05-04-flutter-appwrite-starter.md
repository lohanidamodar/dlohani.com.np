## Introduction
I'm planning to build a lot more applications with Flutter and Appwrite. If you are too, then this is for you. In this series we will build a Starter Template for our FlAppwrite Applications where we will implement some repeatitive tasks like Localization, State management, Authorization etc, that we do for each of our project. So that we can use this as a base template next time we want to create a new FlAppwrite Application.
